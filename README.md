## 📌Overview:
I developed an interactive dashboard to analyze road accident data, focusing on vehicle types, road conditions, and casualty numbers. The aim was to reveal trends and support better road safety strategies.

## 🎯Goal and 🚧Challenges:
To insights on accident causes by vehicle type, road conditions, and casualty counts. Challenges included inconsistent data and complex categorization requiring clear visual representation.

## 🔧 Key Features:
- Cleaned and structured raw data for accurate analysis
- Analyzed accidents by vehicle type, road condition (road type, road surface), casualties monthly trends of 2021 vs 2022, Location (Urban or Rural)
- Analyze types of casualties (Fatal, serious, slight)
- Created visualizations using bar and Donut charts
- Added slicers to filter and view each data category easily

## 💡Impact:
The dashboard helps to identify trends, improve safety planning, and make data-driven decisions. It offers a user-friendly experience with dynamic filtering for quick insights.

This project helped me build confidence and apply my Excel skills to analyze real-world road accident data in a meaningful and practical way.
